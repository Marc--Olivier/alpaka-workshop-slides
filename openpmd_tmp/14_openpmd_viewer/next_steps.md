We will continue visualizing a real-life dataset written by PIConGPU with the openPMD-viewer. The openPMD-viewer can be used to automatically visualize openPMD datasets in 2D using matplotlib. The machine-readable metadata of openPMD is used to create a sensible default plot, including e.g. axis labels, plot titles, histograms, units, scale data to SI.
Due to the size of the dataset, the Notebook must now be launched with 16GB of main memory.
Follow next the instructions in the Notebook `viewer.ipynb` in this directory.
