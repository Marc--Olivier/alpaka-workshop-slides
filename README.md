# The outline of the alpaka workshop

# Section - I

## 1 Introduction: What is alpaka, where it is used?
- Support for **heterogeneous architectures** (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs).
- Write once, run anywhereâ€”alpaka abstracts hardware specifics for parallel computing.

## 2 Hands on 1: Installing alpaka and running an example (LUMI)
- Install alpaka with correct cmake backend options
- Compile and run an alpaka example from the repository.
- Verify it runs on the available hardware (CPU, GPU, etc.).

## 3 Parallel programming concepts and portable parallelization by alpaka
- Grid Structure and WorkDivision
- Data Parallelism
- Indexing

## 4 Hands on 2: HelloIndex kernel which prints indexes

# Section - II

## 1 Memory management for 1D and 2D data
- Memory Allocation, Padding and Pitch

## 2 Filling buffers in parallel
- Use indexing to match thread to data

## 3 Hands on 3: Kernel to fill initial conditions of heat equation

## 4 Heat Equation
- Double accelerator-buffers method to solve Heat Equation
## 5 Preparing stencil kernel
- Difference Equation as a stencil operation

## 6 Hands on 4: Heat Equation stencil kernel

## 7 alpaka programming features and data-structures
- Accelerator, Device, Queue, Task
- Buffers and Views: Managing memory across devices
- alpaka mdspan
- Setting work division manually

## 8 Usability and optimization
- Hands on 5: Using alpaka mdspan for easier indexing 
- Hands on 6: Domain Decomposition, chunking or tiling
- Hands on 7: Using multiple Queues to increase performance. Explore overlap between computation and data transfer
- Hands on 8: Using Shared Memory for chunksExplore overlap between computation and data transfer

## Timing Runs
- Measure the performance of your kernels and analyze the timing with and without shared memory
